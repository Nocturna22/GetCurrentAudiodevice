# GetCurrentAudiodevice

Here's a GitHub repository structure for the PowerShell command you provided:
Windows Sound Device Checker
This repository contains a PowerShell script to retrieve and display the name of the first available and properly functioning sound device on a Windows system.
Script: get-sound-device.ps1

powershell
# Get the first available and properly functioning sound device
`$device = (Get-CimInstance win32_sounddevice | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "OK" -and $_.ConfigManagerErrorCode -eq 0 })[0`

# Display the name of the sound device
`Write-Host $device.Name`

How it works

    The script uses Get-CimInstance to query the win32_sounddevice class, which represents sound devices on the system17.
    It filters the results to include only devices with a "OK" status and a ConfigManagerErrorCode of 0, indicating they are functioning properly1.
    The first device meeting these criteria is selected using ``.
    Finally, the script outputs the name of the selected sound device.
